# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
# 
# There are N points (numbered from 0 to Nâˆ’1) on a plane. Each point is colored either red ('R') or green ('G'). The K-th point is
#  located at coordinates (X[K], Y[K]) and its color is colors[K]. No point lies on coordinates (0, 0).
# We want to draw a circle centered on coordinates (0, 0), such that the number of red points and 
# green points inside the circle is equal. What is the maximum number of points that can lie inside such a circle? 
# Note that it is always possible to draw a circle with no points inside.
