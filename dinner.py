# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
# There are N people sitting at a round table, having dinner. They are numbered from 0 to N-1 in clockwise order. Initially,
# each person has a dish on the table in front of them. Person number K does not like the taste of A[K], but has a dish of taste B[K]. 
# We want every person to have a dish of a taste that they do not dislike, i.e. A[K] â‰  B[K] for each K from 0 to N-1.

# In order to achieve this, you can rotate the whole table clockwise by one position any number of times.
# Rotating the table corresponds to moving the last element of B to the beginning. For example, given A = [3, 6, 4, 5] and B = [2, 6, 3, 5], 
# if we rotate the table once, we would obtain B = [5, 2, 6, 3].

# Find the minimum number of table rotations that need to be performed in order to satisfy every person.
